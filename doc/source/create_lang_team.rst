Creating Language Team
======================

OpenStack I18n team is a team to coordinate all language translations
and cooperation with the I18n team and the development teams.
I18n team usually has a working plan.

Although each language team could follow the I18n team working plan,
your team may also decide your own work items and priorities as a
language team.

If you want to create a language team and you want to be a coordinator,
please follow below steps:

1. Follow :doc:`the step <official_translator>` to register an ID in
   the translation website.

2. Write an email to "openstack-i18n@lists.openstack.org" to introduce
   yourself and the language team you want to create, together with
   your ID on Zanata.

3. When your request is approved, add an item in "Local Translation
   Teams" in the wiki page, create a wiki page under page
   `I18nTeam <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/I18nTeam/team>`_
   (for example, I18nTeam/team/zh_cn) to introduce your team, with
   the following information at least: the contact information,
   the web page, and the work items.

Then, your locale translation team is created successfully.
You can enroll more people to join and start your translation work.

Keep in mind to work with your `local user group
<https://groups.openstack.org/>`_ and the `OpenStack Ambassadors
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Community/AmbassadorProgram>`_
to raise awareness and gather members :)
