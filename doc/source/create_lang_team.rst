Create a Local Translation Team
===============================

OpenStack I18n team is a team to coordinate all language translations
and cooperation with the I18n team and the development teams.
Usually, OpenStack I18n team has work plans. Local translation teams
could follow I18n team's work plans, but as a local translation team
your team may also have the right to decide your own work items and
priorities.

If you want to create a local translation team and you want to be the
coordinator, please follow below steps:

1. Follow :doc:`the step <official_translator>` to register an ID in
   the translation website.

2. Write an email to "openstack-i18n@lists.openstack.org" to introduce
   yourself and the language team you want to create, together with
   your ID on Zanata.

3. When your request is approved, add an item in "Local Translation
   Teams" in the wiki page, create a wiki page under page
   `I18nTeam <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/I18nTeam/team>`_
   (for example, I18nTeam/team/zh_cn) to introduce your team, with below
   information at least: the contact information, the web page, and
   the work items.

Then your locale translation team is created successfully. You can
enroll more people to join and start your translation works.

Don't forget to work with
your `local user group <https://groups.openstack.org/>`_ coordinator and the
`OpenStack Ambassadors <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Community/AmbassadorProgram>`_
to raise awareness and gather members :)
