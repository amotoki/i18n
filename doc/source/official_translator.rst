Steps to become a OpenStack translator
======================================

Translation is another kind of important contribution to OpenStack
community. If you want to become a official translator, you need to
finish following steps:

1. Before you start contribution, you'll have to `agree
   to the contributor license agreement
   <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#account-setup>`_.
   (You can preview the full text of `the OpenStack Individual
   Contributor License Agreement
   <https://review.openstack.org/static/cla.html>`_ first if you want.)

  * Note: If you want to become a translator only, simply speaking,
    you need to `join The OpenStack Foundation
    <https://www.openstack.org/join/>`_
    (select "Foundation Member") and
    `sign the appropriate Individual Contributor License Agreement
    <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#sign-the-appropriate-individual-contributor-license-agreement>`_.

2. Register a user ID in Zanata

  * Go to `Zanata server <https://translate.openstack.org/>`_
  * Click "Log in" button.
  * If you don't have OpenStack ID,
    `register one <https://www.openstack.org/join/register>`_.

    * Note: You are encouraged to register with your business email,
      which will help your company to get the credit. If you don't
      want to, use your personal email will be OK too.

  * After you log in with OpenStack ID, you will be requested to fill in
    your profile.

3. Request to join a translation team

  * Click "Languages" on the top, all languages will be listed.
  * Click the language you want to translate, the language page will
    be shown.
  * Click "..." on the right, and select "Request to join team".
  * Input a short introduction of yourself, including your name, as
    "Additional information", then click "Send message".

    .. note::

       Make sure to include a short introduction because it is the
       only information which language coordinators can use to
       determine your join request is valid or not.

4. When your request is approved, you will get an email
   notification. Then you could start the translation.
