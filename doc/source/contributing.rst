Translations
------------

To help with translation, :doc:`become an official translator <official_translator>`
and join your language team. Then go to `translation website`_ to start translation.
You can find prioritized translation jobs as I18n team at the top of the page.

Your language team may have useful information to help our translation
efforts including translaiton guidelines, priorities, communication
tools and so on. It is worth visited.
You can find your language team page at
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/I18nTeam/team.
If you have questions, you can contact your coordinators.

If you cannot find your local team,
you can request to :doc:`create a local translation team <create_lang_team>`.

To report translation errors, see :doc:`bug_report`.

There are three different roles in a translation team:

Member (translator)
  A person who can submit translations.

Reviewer
  A person who can proofread translations and
  mark them as reviewed (approved) or rejected.

Coordinator
  A privileged member in a translation team who can help
  in team management tasks, such as approving new members
  and reviewing contributions to that language.
  We also have task coordinators for specific tasks.
