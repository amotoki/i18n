Translation jobs status
=======================

We have two types of Jenkins jobs for translations: syncing Zanata with the
latest repositories and pushing translations into the repositories.
`OpenStack Health <http://status.openstack.org/openstack-health/#/>`__
dashboard provides us a convenient way to check the translation job status.

* `Post jobs - syncing to Zanata <http://status.openstack.org/openstack-health/#/g/build_queue/post?groupKey=build_queue&searchJob=translation>`__
* `Periodic jobs: Syncing into repos <http://status.openstack.org/openstack-health/#/g/build_queue/periodic?groupKey=build_queue&searchJob=translation>`__
